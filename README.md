<br>
In this python code, I covered the following: 
<br><br>
#### Part I: Web Scraping <br>
Crawled data from html webpage 

####Part II: Text Processing <br>
The data preprocessing steps for this exercise includes the following:
+ Tokenization — separating text/string data into units (paragraphs, sentences or words)
+ Text Normalization — converting all letters to lower or upper case, removing unnecessary punctuation, empty strings
+ Removing stop words — frequent words such as ”the”, ”is”, etc. that do not have specific semantic
+ Lemmatization — reduce words with different forms like 'loves', 'loving', 'lovely' to a common base form or root word 'love'.
<br>
####Part III: Basic Visualisation for tokenized words <br>
Frequency distribution graph and word cloud
